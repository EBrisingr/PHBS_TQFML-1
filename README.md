4. Relevant Information:

   There are two datasets: 
      1) bank-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
      2) bank.csv with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from bank-full.csv.
   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).

   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

5. Number of Instances: 45211 for bank-full.csv (4521 for bank.csv)

6. Number of Attributes: 16 + output attribute.
