## Motivation:
Over the last few years, Bitcoin has attracted a lot of investors and researchers due to its growing market capitalization, rapidly increasing price and high price volatility. Understanding Bitcoin price formation and particularly predicting its price change are meaningful for investment decision. This project attempts to employ simple LSTM model to Bitcoin price prediction.

We use efficient factors based on existing research to predict Bitcoin price. According to empirical analysis (Ciaian, 2016), Bitcoin market supply-demand fundamentals and Bitcoin’s attractiveness for investors have significant impact on Bitcoin price, while the relevance of macro-financial indicators are statistically insignificant. So we mainly use data for the first two dimensions.


## Goals:
Ultimately, we want to predict the price fluctuation of bitcoin. We want to do forecast about the 'up' and 'down' of price tendency in the future. We will do this in three steps:

**1. Time-series Model: predict the future price (hidden layer)**

For training set, we use ADL model to predict future bitcoin prices roughly on past price and relevant indicators by time series analysis.

**2. Model Modification by Classification: would the future price go up or down? (output)**

Considering that in the real world, ADL model may not fit well, we then use simple LSTM Neural Network Model to allow for both long-term and short-term repeating patterns and get a more reliable signal about the price rise or fall (“+1” means that price going up in the following trading day and “-1” means declining).

**3. Prediction**

Using the modified predicted price and past value of the class feature , we run our model on the test data set.

Overall, we hope that our model can help investors learn something about the future trend of bitcoin price (going up/down) from its past trend and make better investment decisions.

## Data source:
The whole data collection procedure is in [Bitcoin_1_Download_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/LeiZHANG1995/PHBS_TQFML/blob/master/Project/Bitcoin_1_Download_Data.ipynb) file. Please click the link to find more about data collection. In general, we picked 355 day’s data consisting of 6 variables from May 2nd, 2017 to May 1st, 2018 on a daily basis. The explained variable in our research is the price of bitcoins (“price”). About the features used, we mainly divided the variables into two groups.

First group of features are related to demand and supply of bitcoins. 
* the number of bitcoins circulated in the market (“supply”) measures total supply;
* the total USD value of bitcoin supply in circulation (“capital”) indicates the market size;
* the total USD value of trading volume on major bitcoin exchanges (“trade”) provides trading information.

All the above variables come from https://blockchain.info/for and depict the demand and supply of bitcoins. Also we include “date” as a variable for time series analysis.

Second group of features depicts the attractiveness of bitcoins to investors. We adopted views on Wikipedia (wiki) from https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews. We didn’t use Google’s search data because it’s on a weekly basis which does not meet our requirement.

## Models
Briefly, we combine the traditional classifiation algorithm (Logistic Regression) and time series regression (ADL model) together. We call our original algorithm **LSTM** model, which is inspired from the LSTM neural network model. If you are interested in the realization of this method, you can find all the details in the [LSTM.py](https://github.com/LeiZHANG1995/PHBS_TQFML/blob/master/Project/LSTM.py) file. The results of data analysis are all displayed in [Bitcoin_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/LeiZHANG1995/PHBS_TQFML/blob/master/Project/Bitcoin_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb) file, and please click the link to find more details. 

### ADL model
ADL (Autoregressive distributed lag) model is given in the following form:

$$ P_t = \beta (1+L+L^2+...+L^{k-1})P_{t-1}+\alpha (1+L+L^2+...+L^{k-1})X_{t-1} $$

This model combine both prediction and explanation together, and is the "best" (Professor Jiaxiang Zhu) time series model in econometrics' view. This model is evaluated in two steps:

1) Do first order difference on both sides of the regression equation

2) Using OLS to estimate the parameters: using QR decomposition to improve accuracy

After estimation, we can use the estimated model to do prediction. If the `lag` order is _k_, given _P_ from 1 to _k_ period, we are able to predict the _P_ of _k_+1 preiod using this ADL model. 

### LSTM model
From previous step, we can get a set of predicted _P_. Compare those predicted _P_ with the real price, and we can draw some conclusion about the future price fluctuation. But does this prediction reliable? We don't think so. 

One we to improve the reliability of this "up and down" judgement is to take the predicted price leve as the hidden layer, and further do some classifcation on our hidden layer. The final output would combine both the predicted _y_ and other information that we think is of value. This modification might improve the prediction accuracy. 

As for the added information that we consider in the second layer (classification), we add the price fluctuation of the previous period. This makes our model a little bit similar to the _Long and Short Term Memory_ neural network model. 

### Fit the data window recursively
This is not enough. Our data ranges a year, and the data pattern may differ in different time periods. Ws say, the price tendency goes up in the first 3 months, and goes down in the nest 4 months. Both ADL regression and Logistic classification are linear model, and would you believe the trained model of the pooled training data? No we don't. 

How to fix this problem? Our group choose a recursive way of estimation and prediction. We do our LSTM algorithm on moving data windows. The window length can be 40 days or 50 days. We first select the window from 1st-40th period and do LSTM estimation, and then we move the data window to 2nd-41th period, and repeat this procedure. 

This reiursive window way can be implement ob both the **training set** and **test set**. It can improve the performance of training accuracy, but it can cause overfitting problems if we selece a short window length.
